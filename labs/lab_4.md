# Lab 4: Form

## Tasks

- Add a nested form route `/dashboard/new`
- Add link to `/dashboard` to show the form (link should then disappear)
- The form should appear on the top, with existing URLs below
- Implement saving data via `action(...)`. Hide form after saving (i.e. navigate to `/dashboard`)
- Implement delete functionality. Add delete button next to each URL item. Use [fetcher API](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher).
